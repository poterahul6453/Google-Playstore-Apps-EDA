# EDA and Feature Engineering on Google Play Store Dataset

## 📝 Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** on a dataset of Google Play Store applications. The goal is to gain insights into the mobile app market and uncover key trends, such as the most popular app categories, highest-rated apps, and apps with the most installs.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
With over 2.5 million apps available on the Google Play Store, understanding the market is crucial for developers and data analysts. This project aims to analyze a dataset of these apps to address questions like:
- Which app categories are the most popular?
- What is the relationship between an app's size, number of installs, and its rating?
- How does the pricing model affect an app's popularity?

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- **Identified and handled data quality issues**, including missing values and a significant outlier in the `Rating` column (a value of 19.0).
- **Engineered new features** to better understand the data.
- **Analyzed app popularity** based on various metrics to find top-performing applications.

## ⚙️ Technologies and Libraries
The analysis was conducted using Python and the following key libraries:
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Warnings** for managing runtime warnings.
